# Weather Sim

This is a 2D weather simulator is based upon an Eulerian grid-based fluid sim.

The simulator is updated with a Gauss-Seidel method rather than a Jacobi, leading to a faster rate of convergence.

The simulator supports
- Wind
- Clouds
- Rain
- Water masses
- 'Walls'
- Simplified tempture

There is contained two projects, one for the library itself and another for a simple example application of a previewer/editor.
